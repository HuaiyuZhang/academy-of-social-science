# AI academy of social science

Welcome to the Academy of Social Science Consisting of AI Agents! This repository contains a framework for simulating a virtual academy where AI agents collaborate, debate, and engage in social science research across various disciplines like economics, sociology, psychology, political science, and more.

## Introduction

This project aims to build a simulated environment where AI agents represent virtual social scientists. These agents are designed to analyze data, form hypotheses, debate theories, and collaborate on virtual academic projects. The overarching goal is to create a scalable model of an academic community using artificial intelligence, pushing the boundaries of AI in social science.

## Features
**Multi-Agent Collaboration**: AI agents simulate real-world academic dynamics such as collaboration, publication, and peer review.

**Domain Specialization**: Agents are designed to specialize in different branches of social science, allowing for interdisciplinary research.

**Debate Mechanism**: Built-in debate and argumentation structure allows agents to engage in productive disagreements.

## Architecture

The core components of the system include:

**Agent Layer**: Individual AI agents, each representing a researcher with a specific domain focus, designed using natural language processing and machine learning models.

**Interaction Layer**: Facilitates communication and collaboration among agents, managing tasks like joint research, debate, and peer review.

**Data Layer**: Provides agents with access to various datasets, allowing them to perform research, analysis, and hypothesis testing.

**Simulation Layer**: Orchestrates the overall behavior of the system, ensuring smooth interactions between agents and realistic academic processes.
